My name is Nadia Heart. I am a graphic artist and I work in inkart, lineart and grisaille techniques.
I found my artistic expression in achromatic colors that remind me of rain, moonlight and warm thick fog.
My father is Ukrainian and my mother is Buryatian. I was born and raised in Kyiv. I also live and work here. I`m in love with my city, which impresses with its history and cultural heritage.
My works reveal themes of light sadness, nostalgia, aesthetic of a regular life. I am inspired by poetic sadness, which pushes me to an inner monologue, but does not lead to tragedy. Many of these considerations I often take from the aesthetic views of Eastern countries. In Japanese culture there is the concept of "mono-no avare", which means "sad charm of things", and the word "natsukassii", which expresses a happy and sweet nostalgia when you are filled with tenderness from pleasant memories. I find these moods interesting for dialogue with the viewer, who is tired of the modern world problems, and seeks mental and visual relaxation.
In addition, I am also concerned about the ecology of the planet, environmental protection and charity. Environmental friendliness is one of the principles of my activity. This position affects a certain choice of materials, their conscious use and disposal.
Environmental protection is another topic that I raise in my work.
If you have read so far, my dear guest, please, before moving on to the pictures section, imagine that you are sitting alone near  the window in your favorite coffee shop, enjoying a quiet and warm evening, and watching the changing life of the street and its people.
