My name is Nadia Heart. I am a graphic artist from Ukraine.I work in inkart, lineart and grisaille techniques.I found my artistic expression in achromatic colors that remind me of rain, sadness and warm thick fog.My father is Ukrainian and my mother is Buryatian. I was born and raised in Kyiv. I also live and work here. I`m in love with my city, which impresses with its history and cultural heritage.
My works can be described as intimate, aesthetic, graceful.I am inspired by poetic sadness, which pushes me to an inner monologue, but does not lead to tragedy. Many of these considerations I often take from the aesthetic views of Eastern countries. In Japanese culture there is the concept of "mono-no avare", which means "sad charm of simple things". In my works I try to depict this feeling through my body and things that surround me.
